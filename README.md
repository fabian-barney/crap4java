# crap-java

CRAP metrics for Java.

It combines method cyclomatic complexity with JaCoCo method coverage and reports CRAP scores.
The toolkit resolves Maven and Gradle modules natively, including standard multi-module layouts, and publishes a standalone CLI plus dedicated Gradle and Maven plugins.

## Modules

- `core`: analysis engine, build-tool-neutral CLI orchestration, and Maven/Gradle coverage runner
- `cli`: executable entrypoint that bundles the core as a runnable jar
- `gradle-plugin`: self-contained Gradle plugin build exposing `media.barney.crap-java`
- `maven-plugin`: native Maven plugin exposing the `check` goal

## Formula

`CRAP = CC^2 * (1 - coverage)^3 + CC`

- `CC` is cyclomatic complexity.
- `coverage` is the lower available method coverage fraction from JaCoCo
  `INSTRUCTION` and `BRANCH` counters. JaCoCo omits `BRANCH` counters for
  branchless methods, so those methods use instruction coverage.

## Coverage Pipeline

For each resolved module today:

1. Detect Maven or Gradle automatically, unless `--build-tool` is supplied.
2. Delete stale JaCoCo artifacts for the detected build tool.
3. Run the module-scoped coverage command:
   - Maven: `mvn` or `mvnw`, using JaCoCo `0.8.13`
   - Gradle: `gradle` or `gradlew`, running `test` and `jacocoTestReport`
4. Read the module report:
   - Maven: `target/site/jacoco/jacoco.xml`
   - Gradle: `build/reports/jacoco/test/jacocoTestReport.xml`
5. Analyze the selected Java files for that module

## Build and Test

```bash
mvn -B -pl cli -am package
```

Build and test the Gradle plugin module after packaging the core jar:

```bash
mvn -B -pl core -am package
cd gradle-plugin
./gradlew test
```

Build and test the Maven plugin module, including its invoker integration fixtures:

```bash
mvn -B -pl maven-plugin -am verify
```

## Shared Cognitive Gate

Repository CI also runs the shared published `cognitive-java` Maven plugin as a
separate `cognitive-java Gate` job. The plugin resolves from Maven Central, and
the current version is controlled by the `cognitive-java.version` property in
`pom.xml`.

From the repository root, run the same gate locally with:

```bash
mvn -B cognitive-java:check
```

`mvn -B verify` now also includes the cognitive gate at the reactor root.

## Self-Hosting Gate Scope

Consumer Maven repos standardize on `mvn -B -ntp verify`, but this repository
keeps dedicated self-hosting gate jobs where needed to preserve full-repo metric
ownership across the embedded `gradle-plugin/` source tree.

In CI:

- `crap-java Gate` owns `core`, `cli`, `maven-plugin`, and `gradle-plugin/src/main/java`
- `cognitive-java Gate` owns the same full-repo source scope
- `Gradle Plugin` validates Gradle plugin build and test behavior only

The standalone `Gradle Plugin` job is not the owner of metric failures for
`gradle-plugin/src/main/java`; those failures still belong to the metric gate
jobs.

## Run

Build the CLI jar:

```bash
mvn -B -pl cli -am -DskipTests package
```

From the project root you want to analyze:

```bash
java -jar cli/target/crap-java-cli-0.4.1.jar
```

## CLI

```text
--help                Print usage to stdout
(no args)             Analyze all Java files under any nested src/main/java tree
--changed             Analyze changed Java files under any nested src/main/java tree
--build-tool <tool>   Force `auto`, `maven`, or `gradle`
--format <format>     Write `toon`, `json`, `text`, or `junit` output (`toon` by default)
--output <path>       Write the selected output format to a file instead of stdout
--junit-report <path> Also write a JUnit XML report for CI test-report UIs
--threshold <number>  Override the CRAP threshold (`8.0` by default)
<file ...>            Analyze only these files
<directory ...>       Analyze all Java files under each directory's nested src/main/java trees
```

Examples:

```bash
java -jar cli/target/crap-java-cli-0.4.1.jar --help
java -jar cli/target/crap-java-cli-0.4.1.jar
java -jar cli/target/crap-java-cli-0.4.1.jar --changed
java -jar cli/target/crap-java-cli-0.4.1.jar --build-tool gradle
java -jar cli/target/crap-java-cli-0.4.1.jar --format json
java -jar cli/target/crap-java-cli-0.4.1.jar --format text
java -jar cli/target/crap-java-cli-0.4.1.jar --format junit --output target/crap-java/TEST-crap-java.xml
java -jar cli/target/crap-java-cli-0.4.1.jar --junit-report target/crap-java/TEST-crap-java.xml
java -jar cli/target/crap-java-cli-0.4.1.jar --threshold 6
java -jar cli/target/crap-java-cli-0.4.1.jar --build-tool maven module-a/src/main/java/demo/Sample.java
java -jar cli/target/crap-java-cli-0.4.1.jar src/main/java/demo/Sample.java
java -jar cli/target/crap-java-cli-0.4.1.jar module-a module-b
```

The CLI writes only the requested report format to stdout, making the default
TOON output suitable for agent workflows. Warnings and threshold errors are
written to stderr. Machine-readable reports include top-level `status`
(`passed` or `failed`) and `threshold` values, plus method-level
`coverageKind` values identifying the coverage input used for each CRAP score
(`instruction`, `branch`, or `N/A`).

The default threshold is `8.0`. Values below `4.0` print a warning because they
are likely too noisy; values above `8.0` print a warning because they are too
lenient even for hard gates. The warning recommends `8.0` for hard gates,
targeting `6.0` during implementation, and using the `8.0` default when in
doubt.

The JUnit XML format exposes each analyzed method as a testcase. Methods with
CRAP scores over the configured threshold fail, methods with unavailable
coverage are skipped, and the testsuite properties include the global
threshold. Testcase properties include the score, complexity, coverage percent,
coverage kind, source path, and line range.

## Distribution

Public releases ship through Maven Central, with the Gradle Plugin Portal as the primary Gradle plugin channel:

- `media.barney:crap-java-core:<version>`
- `media.barney:crap-java-cli:<version>`
- `media.barney:crap-java-maven-plugin:<version>`
- Gradle plugin id `media.barney.crap-java` version `<version>`

### Gradle Plugin Portal

Apply the plugin in `build.gradle(.kts)`:

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("media.barney.crap-java") version "<version>"
}
```

No custom `pluginManagement` repository configuration is required for published releases.

Run:

```bash
./gradlew crap-java-check
```

The Gradle task writes a JUnit XML report by default to
`build/reports/crap-java/TEST-crap-java.xml`.

Override the threshold in `build.gradle(.kts)`:

```kotlin
crapJava {
    threshold.set(6.0)
}
```

### Maven Central Gradle Plugin

If you want to prefer resolving the Gradle plugin from Maven Central, add Maven Central ahead of the Plugin Portal in `settings.gradle(.kts)`:

```kotlin
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        gradlePluginPortal()
    }
}
```

Then apply the same plugin id in `build.gradle(.kts)`:

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("media.barney.crap-java") version "<version>"
}
```

The marker publication lives at `media.barney.crap-java:media.barney.crap-java.gradle.plugin:<version>` and resolves to the implementation artifact `media.barney:crap-java-gradle-plugin:<version>`.

### Maven Central

Add the plugin:

```xml
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.jacoco</groupId>
      <artifactId>jacoco-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>0.8.13</version>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <goals>
            <goal>prepare-agent</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
        <execution>
          <id>report</id>
          <phase>verify</phase>
          <goals>
            <goal>report</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>media.barney</groupId>
      <artifactId>crap-java-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>&lt;version&gt;</version>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <goals>
            <goal>check</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
```

The Maven plugin consumes the JaCoCo XML files produced by your build. It does not spawn a nested Maven run to generate coverage.

No custom `<pluginRepositories>` or consumer-side authentication are required for published releases.

Run:

```bash
mvn verify
```

The Maven plugin writes a JUnit XML report by default to
`target/crap-java/TEST-crap-java.xml`. Override the path with:

```bash
mvn verify -DcrapJava.junitReportPath=target/custom-crap-java.xml
```

Override the threshold with:

```bash
mvn verify -DcrapJava.threshold=6.0
```

In GitLab CI, upload the generated XML with `artifacts:reports:junit`. In
GitHub Actions, upload the file as an artifact or feed it into a JUnit
test-report action.

## Exit Codes

- `0` success, threshold respected
- `1` invalid CLI usage
- `2` CRAP threshold exceeded (`> configured threshold`)
